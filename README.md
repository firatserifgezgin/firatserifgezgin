- 👋 Hi, I’m @firatserifgezgin

- 👀 I’m interested in various topics in condensed matter theory where one can apply techniques borrowed from various branches of physics such as nuclear physics, high-energy physics and QFT.
It is fascinating for me to learn new ways of examining the problems that has been worked before but in a finer detail. One example could be study of topological phases of gapless fermionic systems where one can now further distinguish critical and metallic phases into confined and deconfined phases.

- 🌱 I’m currently doing research on the following topics: 
- 1. Study and materialization exotic spin models to be used for quantum computation, i.e. solid state systems, cold atoms. 
- 2. Keldysh approach for superconducting or hybrid systems
- 3. Theoretical account for Skyrmions with a very short-time scale generation
- 4. Quantum computation in analog systems, such as photonic wave-guides, electric circuits and phononic system.

- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate on both physics and engineering topics: 
- 1. Monte-Carlo or DMRG based characterization of the two-component spin Hamiltonians with a kinetic term breaking the particle-hole symmetry (to be added here)
- 2. Study of confined and deconfied phases of Kitaev model under a magnetic field
- 3.
